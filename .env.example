# Authentication Mode
# =============================================================================
# Asetate supports two authentication modes:
#
# 1. SELF-HOSTED MODE (Personal Access Token)
#    - Leave DISCOGS_CONSUMER_KEY and DISCOGS_CONSUMER_SECRET empty
#    - Users enter their Discogs username and Personal Access Token in the app
#    - Best for: single-user self-hosted deployments
#
# 2. HOSTED MODE (OAuth)
#    - Set DISCOGS_CONSUMER_KEY and DISCOGS_CONSUMER_SECRET below
#    - Users sign in with "Sign in with Discogs" button
#    - Best for: multi-user hosted deployments

# Discogs OAuth credentials (ONLY for hosted/multi-user mode)
# Get these from: https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers
# 1. Create a new application
# 2. Set the callback URL to: http://localhost:5000/auth/callback (adjust for production)
# 3. Copy the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret here
# DISCOGS_CONSUMER_KEY=your-consumer-key
# DISCOGS_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-consumer-secret

# Flask environment (development/production)
FLASK_ENV=development
